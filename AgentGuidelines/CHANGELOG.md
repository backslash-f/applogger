# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.0.27] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Preserved valid GitHub alert syntax in the Markdown wrapping audit while continuing to reject hard-wrapped alert bodies, ordinary blockquotes, malformed alert markers, and nested alerts.

## [0.0.26] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Added a fail-closed completion-audit helper that requires structured Xcode String Catalog editor evidence for every changed `.xcstrings` file.
- Added native Swift tests for guideline, consumer-integration, Markdown, and String Catalog automation.

### Changed

- Moved the shared localization guide from `Guidelines/Swift/` to `Guidelines/` and updated repository and consumer-template links.
- Replaced Python validation, localization, and audit-helper scripts with native Swift executables, and moved CI and release validation to macOS runners.
- Required new repository-owned executable scripts in Swift-focused repositories to use Swift, with the existing `swift_format.sh` wrapper retained as a narrow exception.

## [0.0.25] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Added generic generated-symbol localization guidance plus reusable String Catalog preparation and validation scripts with consumer-configured paths and languages.
- Added an Xcode project-settings baseline covering warnings-as-errors, strict and approachable concurrency, default MainActor isolation, the latest stable Swift language mode, and every upcoming feature that remains opt-in for that language mode.
- Added documentation conventions for single-line Markdown prose and aligned ASCII diagrams, together with a deterministic wrapping checker.

### Changed

- Expanded the completion audit to verify localization workflows, project-level Xcode setting inheritance and documented exceptions, documentation formatting, and convention adoption across existing durable documentation.
- Updated the consumer template and guideline catalog for the new Xcode project-settings and localization workflows.

## [0.0.24] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Added a versioned external-dependency contract to consumer `AGENTS.md` files so applications, games, and reusable packages default to native or ThatFactory-owned implementations and require explicit repository-owner approval plus a durable decision record for third-party product dependencies.
- Extended the completion audit and consumer-setup validation to detect unapproved or undocumented dependency additions and contract drift.

### Changed

- Clarified package guidance so first-party packages cannot conceal third-party runtime dependencies and guideline-mandated tooling remains tooling-only.

## [0.0.23] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Added a versioned documentation-maintenance contract to the consumer `AGENTS.md` template and consumer-setup validation so guideline upgrades detect projects that have not adopted the contract.

### Changed

- Strengthened documentation guidance and the completion audit so durable behavior changes and any change that makes existing documentation stale require documentation updates, while incidental implementation details do not create documentation churn.

## [0.0.22] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Required completion audits to verify and repair shared AppLogger integration for ThatFactory Apple-platform applications and Swift packages.

## [0.0.21] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- Clarified that the bounded review-round policy applies to Codex GitHub reviews, while otherwise-authorized ChatGPT and Reasoning Relay delegations use their own workflow limits.
- Namespaced Codex review tracking fields and advanced the consumer code-review contract to v2.

## [0.0.20] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- Documented squash merge as the default for ThatFactory repositories and instructed agents to use `gh pr merge <pull-request> --squash` instead of attempting merge commits.

## [0.0.19] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Added a complete README badge-block example covering Swift, Xcode, platform, package manager, agent/tooling, DocC, license, updated, revision, CI, and publishing badges.

### Changed

- Updated this repository's README badges to use the canonical order and applicable tooling, release, and maintenance badges.
- Updated the README contract validator to require the canonical `Xcode MCP` badge alt text.

## [0.0.18] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- Corrected the standard README badge order to place DocC/documentation before license, updated date, revision, CI badges, and release/publishing status.

## [0.0.17] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- A version-marked consumer Code Review contract that defines P0/P1 release blockers, non-blocking P2/P3 observations, and bounded follow-up review scope.
- A deterministic consumer-setup validator for review-contract drift, subtree review scope, `.gitattributes`, local guide links, audit-skill wiring, and Swift-format adoption.

### Changed

- Expanded the global Codex instruction template and pull-request workflow to prioritize concrete release risk, group shared root causes, and stop review loops after blockers are resolved.
- Extended the completion-audit skill to verify consumer integration, review convergence, Swift-format configuration, local execution, and non-mutating CI coverage.
- Documented explicit Swift package formatting before tests and added a strict Swift-format CI template with package path coverage.

## [0.0.16] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- Required SwiftUI dynamic properties to precede ordinary stored properties and clarified deterministic preview expectations.
- Required one top-level type per file, focused function decomposition, logical enum grouping, and consistent declaration-modifier and multiline-signature layout.
- Documented which declaration layout conventions remain review-guided because swift-format cannot enforce them without broad source reflow.

## [0.0.15] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- A shared agent-workflow guide for bounded grouping of independent repository inspections, with dependency, ordering, scope, and output-size safeguards.
- A versioned global Codex instruction template that bootstraps discovery of repository-local guidance without duplicating engineering policy.

### Changed

- Linked the workflow guide from the consumer template, documented the manual global Codex setup, and required alphabetical ordering of the README guideline catalog.
- Clarified that Codex review requests are automatic by default and must not be triggered manually without an explicit user request.

## [0.0.14] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- Clarify Store/Middleware @MainActor usage.
- Removed workaround for a resolved Xcode issue.

## [0.0.13] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- A reusable `agent-guidelines-audit` skill and mandatory completion gate before handoff, pull requests, merge readiness, and releases.
- A canonical Redux Store template plus dependency-container and middleware-composition guidance.
- Consumer Stack guidance for recording toolchain, platform, strict-concurrency, and actor-isolation settings.

### Changed

- Clarified Redux folder ownership, familiar domain grouping, model-versus-tool classification, service-local helpers, presentation models, and one-component-per-file organization.
- Required documentation for new Swift declarations, meaningful `MARK` sections, one meaningful SwiftUI view per file, and deterministic previews where possible.
- Clarified when target isolation defaults replace explicit annotations and when compiler-verified boundaries still require them.
- Enabled conditional-import sorting and expanded validation for Swift templates, the audit skill, Stack guidance, and formatting policy.

## [0.0.12] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Login-shell guidance for using explicitly authorized `gh` credentials exported by local shell startup configuration without exposing token values.

## [0.0.11] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Pre-compilation Xcode build-phase guidance and a reusable `format-and-lint` command for human and agent workflows.
- An easy-to-find record of Xcode-aligned layout settings, enabled rule overrides, and deliberate non-adoptions.
- Pull-request guidance that prevents duplicate manual Codex requests when automatic review is enabled.

### Changed

- Enabled empty-array literals, force-try rejection, brace whitespace cleanup, `where` clauses in eligible loops, and documentation-comment validation.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Shared Xcode-aligned swift-format and EditorConfig configuration.
- Reusable format, warning-lint, and strict-lint commands for Swift consumers.

### Changed

- Replaced SwiftLint guidance with toolchain-native swift-format guidance.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-07-23

### Added

## [0.0.8] - 2026-07-23

### Added
